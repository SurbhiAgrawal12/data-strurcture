// Kth most frequent Character in a given String
// Given a string str and an integer K, the task is to find the K-th most frequent character in the string. 
// If there are multiple characters that can account as K-th most frequent character then, print any one of them.

// Examples:

// Input: str = “GeeksforGeeks”, K = 3
// Output: f
// Explanation:
// K = 3, here ‘e’ appears 4 times
// & ‘g’, ‘k’, ‘s’ appears 2 times
// & ‘o’, ‘f’, ‘r’ appears 1 time.
// Any output from ‘o’ (or) ‘f’ (or) ‘r’ will be correct.
