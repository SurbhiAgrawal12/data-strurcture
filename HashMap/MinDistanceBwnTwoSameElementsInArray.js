// Minimum distance between any two equal elements in an Array
// Given an array arr, the task is to find the minimum distance between any two same elements in the array. If no such element is found, return -1.

// Examples:

// Input: arr = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// There are two matching pairs of values: 1 and 2 in this array.
// Minimum Distance between two 1’s = 4
// Minimum Distance between two 2’s = 2
// Therefore, Minimum distance between any two equal elements in the Array = 2
