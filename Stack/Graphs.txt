1. A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices(nodes) and edges. 
2. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes 
3. and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. 
4. The graph is denoted by G(E, V).

UseCase: Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. 
Graphs are used to represent networks. 
The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network.
Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. 
For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). 
Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale etc.

two types of Grpah:
1. Directed Graph
2. Undirected Graph 

weighted Graph:
1. weighted Directed Graph
2. weighted Undirected Graph 

cyclic graph
Acyclic graph

Nodes: Entity to store data
edges: connecting nodes
path: 

In Undirected Graph -> we have degree
In Directed Graph -> we have Indegree and Outdegree

Adjacency matrix
adjacency list
