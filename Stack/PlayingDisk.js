// Playing Disk

// Varun works in in a club and plays cool songs. He has n disks of different albums(each of equal radius). 
//Every disk has distinct number out of 1 to N associated with it. Disks are placed one over the other in a 
// single pile. Varun wants to sort this pile of disks in an increasing order i.e. top to bottom. 
//But he has a very special method of doing this. In a single step he can only choose one disk 
// out of the pile and he can only put it at the top. so the task here is that Varun wants to sort his pile of 
//disks in minimum number of possible steps. What is the minimum number of possible steps to sort 
// the pile so that Varun can check whether 
// he is doing his work right or wrong?

// Input Format
// First line contains integer N, the size of the array followed by, an array of size N containing integers 1 to N in any random order 
// which shows the position of disks top to bottom.

// Constraints
// 0<=N<=1000

//Output Format
// Print the minimum number of steps needed to sort the pile. If it can't be sorted then return output as -1.
